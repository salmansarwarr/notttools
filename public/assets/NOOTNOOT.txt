Important notice

NOOTTOOLS SL expressly warns users about the risks related to cryptocurrency markets and cryptoassets:

Volatility risk – Investments in cryptoassets may fluctuate significantly in value, both upwards and downwards, and investors may even lose their entire investment.

Startup risk – Investments in early-stage or “startup” projects entail a high level of risk, requiring a thorough understanding of the business model.

Lack of protection – Cryptoassets are not covered by customer protection mechanisms such as the Deposit Guarantee Fund or the Investor Compensation Scheme.

Liquidity risk – Many cryptoassets suffer from low liquidity, which may make it difficult or impossible to sell assets without incurring significant losses.

Technology risk – Distributed ledger technologies are still in an early stage of development and may present operational or security vulnerabilities.

Protocol attack risk – Distributed networks rely on consensus mechanisms that may be vulnerable to attacks. In the event of a successful attack, balances and cryptoassets could be permanently lost.

Cybersecurity risk – Due to the pseudonymous or anonymous nature of cryptoassets, they are frequent targets for cybercriminals. Theft of private keys or credentials could result in the irretrievable loss of funds.

Custody risk – Proper custody of private keys is crucial. Losing access credentials can result in the total loss of cryptoassets.

Limited acceptance – Cryptoassets are not widely accepted as a means of payment, and there is no legal obligation for third parties to accept them.

Jurisdictional risk – If the service provider is located outside the European Union, resolving disputes can be costly and may fall outside the jurisdiction of EU authorities.
